User Management Dashboard:

This is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details from a mock backend API. It is built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios, and React Router DOM.


Usage:

The User Management Dashboard displays a list of users with details such as ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.
We can add a new user by clicking the "Add User" button and filling out the form.
To edit a user's details, click the "Edit" button next to the user and update the form.
To delete a user, click the "Delete" button next to the user.


Assumptions:

The JSONPlaceholder API is used for demonstration and test purposes, specifically the /users endpoint.
The API does not actually add, update, or delete users but simulates successful responses.
Client-side validation is not implemented for the user input form.
The interface is responsive.


Reflection:

During the development process, I faced challenges in handling API requests and managing the application state. I overcame these challenges by using Axios for HTTP requests and React's state management capabilities.
If given more time, I would:
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the user list to improve performance with a large number of users.
Add client-side validation for the user input form to ensure data integrity.
Enhance the error handling by displaying more informative error messages to the user.
